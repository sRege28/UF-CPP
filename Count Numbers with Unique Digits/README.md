Tags: ___DP___, ___Medium___, ___Backtracking___, ___Match___

Given a non-negative integer n, count all numbers with unique digits, x, where 0 ≤ x < 10^n.

Example:
Given n = 2, return 91. (The answer should be the total numbers in the range of 0 ≤ x < 100, excluding `[11,22,33,44,55,66,77,88,99]`)
