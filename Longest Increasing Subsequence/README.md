## Longest Increasing Subsequence
Tags: ___DP___, ___Medium___, ___Binary Search___

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

For example,
Given `[10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]`, The longest increasing subsequence is `[2, 3, 7, 101]`, therefore the length is `4`. Note that there may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.

Your algorithm should run in _O(n^2)_ complexity.

Follow up: Could you improve it to _O(nlogn)_ time complexity?

## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N)___ space. Or another solution and achieve xxxxxxx.

## Notes
The possible corner case includes
* xxxxxxx
* xxxxxxx
* .....

Using xxx will result stack overflow. xxxxxxx

You can also add the guidance for how to use the test cases.
