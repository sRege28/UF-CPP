# 537. Complex Number Multiplication
Tags: __Medium__, __Math__, __String__, __Amazon__

Given two strings representing two [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).

You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i^2 = -1 according to the definition.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: "1+1i", "1+1i"
Output: "0+2i"
Explanation: (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.
```
__Example 2:__
```
Input: "1+-1i", "1+-1i"
Output: "0+-2i"
Explanation: (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.
```
__Note:__
1. The input strings will not have extra blank.
2. The input strings will be given in the form of `a+bi`, where the integer `a` and `b` will both belong to the range of `[-100, 100]`. And __the output should be also in this form__.
