# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Tags: __Array__, __DP__, __Easy__

Say you have an array for which the _ith_ element is the price of a given stock on day `i`.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

__Example 1:__
```
Input: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
Output: 5

max. difference = 6-1 = 5 (not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price)
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input: [7, 6, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 0

In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```
