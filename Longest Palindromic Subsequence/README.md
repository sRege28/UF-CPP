Tags: ___DP___, ___Medium___

Given a string s, find the longest palindromic subsequence's length in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.

Example 1:  
Input: `"bbbab"`, Output: `4`.One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

Example 2:  
Input:`"cbbd"`, Output:`2`. One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".

## Source

* from [leetcode q516](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence "Longest Palindromic Subsequence")

## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N)___ space. Or another solution and achieve xxxxxxx.

## Notes
The possible corner case includes
* xxxxxxx
* xxxxxxx
* .....

Using xxx will result stack overflow. xxxxxxx

You can also add the guidance for how to use the test cases.
