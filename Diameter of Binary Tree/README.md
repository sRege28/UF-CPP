## Diameter of Binary Tree
Tags: ___Tree___, ___Easy___

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the __longest__ path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:
Given a binary tree
```
     1
    / \
   2   3
  / \     
 4   5    
```
Return __3__, which is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

__Note__: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.
