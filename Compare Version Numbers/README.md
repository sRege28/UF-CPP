# 165. Compare Version Numbers
Tags: __Medium__, __String__, __Microsoft__, __Apple__

Compare two version numbers _version1_ and _version2_.
If _version1 > version2_ return 1, if _version1_ < _version2_ return -1, otherwise return 0.

You may assume that the version strings are non-empty and contain only digits and the `.` character.
The `.` character does not represent a decimal point and is used to separate number sequences.
For instance, `2.5` is not "two and a half" or "half way to version three", it is the fifth second-level revision of the second first-level revision.

Here is an example of version numbers ordering:
`
0.1 < 1.1 < 1.2 < 13.37
`
