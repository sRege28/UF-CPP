# 146. LRU Cache
Tags: ___Hard___, __Design__, __Google__, __Facebook__, __Microsoft__, __Amazon__, __Bloomberg__, __Uber__, __Twitter__, __Snapchat__, __Zenefits__, __Yahoo__, __Palantir__

Design and implement a data structure for [Least Recently Used (LRU) cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#LRU). It should support the following operations: `get` and `put`.

`get(key)` - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
`put(key, value)` - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.

Follow up:
Could you do both operations in __O(1)__ time complexity?

__Example:__
```
LRUCache cache = new LRUCache( 2 /* capacity */ );

cache.put(1, 1);
cache.put(2, 2);
cache.get(1);       // returns 1
cache.put(3, 3);    // evicts key 2
cache.get(2);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.put(4, 4);    // evicts key 1
cache.get(1);       // returns -1 (not found)
cache.get(3);       // returns 3
cache.get(4);       // returns 4
```

* from [leetcode 146](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache)

## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N)___ space. Or another solution and achieve xxxxxxx.

## Notes
The possible corner case includes
* xxxxxxx
* xxxxxxx
* .....

Using xxx will result stack overflow. xxxxxxx

You can also add the guidance for how to use the test cases.
