## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(MxN)___ time and ___O(1)___ space. This particular solution uses BFS. Sicne we have to evaluate each and every grid element so the solution is __O(MxN)__ in time complexity. We are keeping a visited matrix to keep track of visited element so in this case space complexity is __O(MxN)__. 

## Notes
Standard BFS so no corner cases for our approach.
