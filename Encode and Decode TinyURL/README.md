## Encode and Decode TinyURL
Tags: ___Medium___, ___System Design___

TinyURL is a URL shortening service where you enter a URL such as `https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl` and it returns a short URL such as `http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk`.

Design the encode and decode methods for the TinyURL service. There is no restriction on how your encode/decode algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.

Your Codec object will be instantiated and called as such:
```
Codec codec = new Codec();
codec.decode(codec.encode(url));
```

## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N)___ space. Or another solution and achieve xxxxxxx.

## Notes
The possible corner case includes
* xxxxxxx
* xxxxxxx
* .....

Using xxx will result stack overflow. xxxxxxx

You can also add the guidance for how to use the test cases.
