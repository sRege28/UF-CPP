# 73. Set Matrix Zeroes
Tags: __Array__, __Medium__, __Amazon__, __Microsoft__

Given a `m x n` matrix, if an element is `0`, set its entire row and column to `0`. Do it in place.

Follow up:
* Did you use extra space?
* A straight forward solution using O(mn) space is probably a bad idea.
* A simple improvement uses O(m + n) space, but still not the best solution.
* Could you devise a constant space solution?

## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N)___ space. Or another solution and achieve xxxxxxx.

## Notes
The possible corner case includes
* xxxxxxx
* xxxxxxx
* .....

Using xxx will result stack overflow. xxxxxxx

You can also add the guidance for how to use the test cases.
