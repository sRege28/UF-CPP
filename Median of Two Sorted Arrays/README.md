# 004. Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Tags: __Hard__, __Array__, __Binary Search__, __Divide and Conquer__, __Google__, __Microsoft__, __Apple__, __Zenefits__, __Yahoo__, __Adobe__, __Dropbox__

There are two sorted arrays **nums1** and **nums2** of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be _**O(log (m+n))**_.

**Example 1:**
```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```
**Example 2**:
```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
