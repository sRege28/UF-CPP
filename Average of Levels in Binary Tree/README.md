## Average of Levels in Binary Tree
Tags: ___Easy___, ___Tree___

Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

__Example 1:__
```
Input:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Output: [3, 14.5, 11]
```
__Explanation:__  
The average value of nodes on level `0` is `3`, on level `1` is `14.5`, and on level `2` is `11`. Hence return `[3, 14.5, 11]`.
