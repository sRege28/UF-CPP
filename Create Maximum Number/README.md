# Create Maximum Number
Tags: ___Hard___, ___DP___, ___Greedy___

Given two arrays of length `m` and `n` with digits `0-9` representing two numbers. Create the maximum number of length `k <= m + n` from digits of the two. The relative order of the digits from the same array must be preserved. Return an array of the `k` digits. You should try to optimize your time and space complexity.

__Example 1:__  
nums1 = `[3, 4, 6, 5]`
nums2 = `[9, 1, 2, 5, 8, 3]`
k = `5`
return `[9, 8, 6, 5, 3]`

__Example 2:__  
nums1 = `[6, 7]`
nums2 = `[6, 0, 4]`
k = `5`
return `[6, 7, 6, 0, 4]`

__Example 3:__  
nums1 = `[3, 9]`
nums2 = `[8, 9]`
k = `3`
return `[9, 8, 9]`

## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N)___ space. Or another solution and achieve xxxxxxx.

## Notes
The possible corner case includes
* xxxxxxx
* xxxxxxx
* .....

Using xxx will result stack overflow. xxxxxxx

You can also add the guidance for how to use the test cases.
