## Brief Intro
Tags: ___Medium___, ___Graph___, ___BFS___, ___DFS___, __Shortest Path__



## Source

* from [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/bfsshortreach "Google's Homepage")

## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(V+E)___ time and ___O(V)___ space. The solution mentioned in this particular solution uses adjacency matrix representation of graph so this solution uses a __O(VxV)__ space and __O(VxV)__ in time. 

## Notes
This is a standard BFS traversal so there are no corner cases for this approach. The question mentions usage of test cases.
