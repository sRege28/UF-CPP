## Subsets
Tags: ___Array___, ___Medium___, ___Backtracking___, ___Bit Manipulation___

Given a set of __distinct__ integers, _nums_, return all possible subsets.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets.

For example,
If __nums__ = `[1,2,3]`, a solution is:
```
[
  [3],
  [1],
  [2],
  [1,2,3],
  [1,3],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  []
]
```

## Complexity/Analysis
The optimal solution can achieve ___O(N)___ time and ___O(N)___ space. Or another solution and achieve xxxxxxx.

## Notes
The possible corner case includes
* xxxxxxx
* xxxxxxx
* .....

Using xxx will result stack overflow. xxxxxxx

You can also add the guidance for how to use the test cases.
